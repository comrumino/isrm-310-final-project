# Outline/Notes
1. Whose the audience?
    - Software/Network/Hardware Engineers
2. Have a tagline (what I would interpret as a intro/topic/title or elevator pitch)
    - Describing the differences and commonalities of [2023 CWE Top 10 KEV Weaknesses](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2023/2023_kev_list.html) and [OWASP API Top Ten 10](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x03-introduction/)
3. The obvious overlap between API Top 10 and KEV Top 10
    - KEV 9, Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'), CWE-22 Analysis score: 19.90 CVE Mappings in KEV: 14 Avg. CVSS: 8.09
    - KEV 10, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, CWE-306 Analysis score: 12.98, CVE Mappings in KEV: 8, Avg. CVSS: 8.86
4. Goals for the video content:
    - Find the aha moment (maybe making it click for people the purpose and imporance of things like CVE/CWE/Top Ten Lists)

# Final Project Assignment

The topic of your final project - Start planning on Day 1
You are going to produce a video that will be used in your portfolio. Think about the effective videos you watch on YouTube.

- Sometimes the video is procedural: you take us through the steps one by one.
- Sometimes the video is process oriented: depending on outcomes, you may take these steps, maybe those steps.
- Sometimes the video is descriptive and tells us about something in detail for us to consider, like what is ransomware.

- Videos should be 3-5 minutes. The more you edit, the better the video. We will have video production assistant. You can outsource - in industry we say "use your resources". This is about a professional outcome that serves others. Success is a video that goes up on YouTube or Vimeo and is used by others.

This course is based on management principles of cybersecurity. So, you will choose a real problem in an organization. Perhaps someone needs a security awareness training program put in place. Perhaps a company needs to write policies for their start-up. Perhaps someone has recently suffered a ransomware attack. Perhaps a group needs a cybersecurity awareness training program put in place. You will identify the problem and present a professional solution to a group of decision makers. 

## Four Considerations

### Find a real world cybersecurity problem in a company.
- Scope it out, define goals, policy, procedures and practices.
- Identify the tools you will use to solve the problem.
- Analyze the current threats.
- Identify the mitigation plan to curb the threat.
- Annotate with references.

### Identify a company that wants to test the strength of their processes.
- Investigate the Cybersecurity Framework
- Identify a part of the organization that could benefit from an incident response plan.
- Evaluate what a tabletop exercise is and how you would conduct. See Tom Muehleisen.
- Identify the process and engagement model.
- Identify how you will roll it out.
- Simulate it to test it.
- Present the results.

### Consider using a case study
- Research a cybersecurity case that happened in real life.
- Use the Cybersecurity Framework and interview the company on how they handled the problem step by step.
- Create an exercise to engage users in figuring out what they should have done in a step-by-step manner.
- Present an end-to-end evaluation and solution.

### Use your teams, and your faculty every week.
- In this course, we are simulating the real world. Think less about this being a class, and more about a testing for your first two months on a job.
- You figure out what to read, what interests you, who you can work with.
- Figure out what the mission and goals and values are of the class and the faculty whom you work for.
- Consider each module as content that you should integrate into your final product.
    - Reference the frameworks
    - Use the legal advice
    - Consider all individuals within the organization (finance, legal, HR, Security Operations Center, Governance, Managers, Marketing)
    - Make appointments to meet with faculty, mentors
    - When given the opportunity to meet experts in the field, pick their brains selfishly

## Rules:
- Everyone must be accountable for the work they engage in and be able to articulate it 
- Everyone must take on a unique role in a team
- You must meet frequently to get your project completed and check in weekly
- You must have a collaborative site so we can judge how you accomplished your goals
- You must do a mid-quarter review
- You must recognize that each of you is at a different level, and make sure you include variety on your teams
